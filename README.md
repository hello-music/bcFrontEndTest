“Welcome back!” component:
yes will bring up a form to enter information about the book (Title, Author, etc)
no will close the component
When the form from 1a is submitted, populate a new component for that book, and render it on the page.
 Do some simple validation on the content to prevent duplicate entries.
Add the ability to add reviews and create a star indicator based on those reviews (1 to 5 scale);
Add sorting based on different attributes of the data (e.g., book title)


Create JSON representations of the content.

Use JavaScript to create the templates

Design notes:
- The 'mobile' view has a menu icon, which when clicked, opens the menu and reveals the 3 menu items.
- The 'desktop' view shows the 3 menu items inline, and the menu icon is not needed.

We've attached the icons in the navigation bar for you to save you time, so do whatever
you wish with them.

Implementation guide:
how you structure and write your code

how you can create re-usable components. 

Don’t worry about persistence of data entered from the form above.

Libraries are allowed, but consider site speed implications when doing so.

Please comment your code, specifically around design decisions you’ve made during the course of implementing your solution.
